## üìÑ Project Summary
This project is a complete, end-to-end computer vision application that classifies images into three categories: 'spoon', 'fork', or 'others'. The primary deliverable is a self-contained, interactive application that runs entirely within a Jupyter/Colab notebook environment using `ipywidgets`.

The project is built with a professional, modular structure and includes archived files for future deployment as a standalone Streamlit web application. The entire workflow is managed by robust Python classes, making the project easy to run, maintain, and share.

## üöÄ Final Workflow

This project has been designed for a simple and efficient workflow.

#### **1. To Run the Interactive Application:**
The main application is a Jupyter Notebook.
-   Open the notebook: `notebooks/Interactive_Utensil_Classifier.ipynb`.
-   Run the cells in order. The first cell sets up the environment, and the second launches the interactive user interface for you to use.

#### **2. To Save Your Project to GitHub:**
A dedicated script handles pushing your entire project to GitHub.
1.  Open the script `push_to_github.py` and fill in your repository URL, username, and email.
2.  From your `Main_Controller.ipynb` or a terminal in the project's root directory, run the command:
    ```bash
    python push_to_github.py
    ```
